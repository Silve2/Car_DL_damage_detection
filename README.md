# 🔍 Car Damage Detection - Machine Learning for Identifying Damaged Cars 🚗

Welcome to **Car Damage Detection**, a **Deep Learning** project that determines whether a car is damaged using **Computer Vision** techniques! 🚀  

## 📝 Description

This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** implementing a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and **EfficientNet** to classify images of cars into two categories:
1. ✅ **Undamaged Cars**
2. ❌ **Damaged Cars**

The goal is to **automate damage assessment** for insurance companies, car dealerships, and rental services. 🏢  

### 🔑 Key Features
- 📂 **Image Dataset Handling**: Loads and processes images efficiently
- 🔄 **Data Augmentation**: Improves model generalization with transformations
- 🧠 **Deep Learning Model**: CNNs & Transfer Learning with **EfficientNet**
- 🧐 **Explainability (XAI)**: Uses **GradCAM & SHAP** for AI transparency
- 🎯 **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
